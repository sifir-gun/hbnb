## Introduction

Welcome to the **HBnB Evolution** project! This repository contains the comprehensive technical documentation for the development of the HBnB application, a simplified version of an Airbnb-like platform. This documentation serves as the foundation for the project's implementation phases, providing clear insights into the application's architecture, design, and interaction flows.

---

## Project Overview

**HBnB Evolution** is a web application that allows users to:

- **User Management**: Register, update profiles, and be identified as regular users or administrators.
- **Place Management**: List properties with details such as name, description, price, and location, along with associated amenities.
- **Review Management**: Leave reviews for places, including ratings and comments.
- **Amenity Management**: Manage amenities that can be associated with places.

The project follows a layered architecture divided into:

- **Presentation Layer**: Services and APIs for user interaction.
- **Business Logic Layer**: Core logic and models of the application.
- **Persistence Layer**: Data storage and retrieval from the database.

## Architecture and Design

### High-Level Package Diagram

The high-level package diagram illustrates the three-layer architecture of the HBnB application and the communication between these layers via the facade pattern. It provides a conceptual overview of how the components are organized and interact.

- **Presentation Layer**: Handles user interactions, including services and API endpoints.
- **Business Logic Layer**: Contains core business logic and models (User, Place, Review, Amenity).
- **Persistence Layer**: Responsible for data storage and retrieval, interacting with the database.

### Business Logic Layer Class Diagram

The detailed class diagram represents the internal structure of the Business Logic layer, focusing on the key entities: User, Place, Review, and Amenity. It includes their attributes, methods, and relationships such as associations, inheritance, and dependencies.

### Sequence Diagrams for API Calls

Sequence diagrams have been developed for four different API calls to illustrate the interaction between the layers and the flow of information within the application:

1. **User Registration**: A user signs up for a new account.
2. **Place Creation**: A user creates a new place listing.
3. **Review Submission**: A user submits a review for a place.
4. **Fetching a List of Places**: A user requests a list of places based on certain criteria.

These diagrams help visualize how different components interact to fulfill specific use cases, showing the step-by-step process of handling API requests.

## Documentation Compilation

All diagrams and explanatory notes have been compiled into a comprehensive technical document. This document serves as a detailed blueprint for the HBnB project, guiding the implementation phases and providing a clear reference for the systemâ€™s architecture and design.

## Usage

Since this phase of the project focuses on technical documentation, there is currently no executable code in the repository. To utilize the documentation:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/hbnb-evolution.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the Documentation**:
   - Open `Documentation_Compilation.md` to access all diagrams and explanations.
   - Diagrams are available in image format within the document for easy reference.

3. **Review the Diagrams**:
   - Use the high-level package diagram to understand the overall architecture.
   - Study the class diagrams to grasp the structure of the business logic layer.
   - Examine the sequence diagrams to follow the interaction flows for various API calls.
